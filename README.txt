🚀 HOW TO OPEN & RUN
----------------------------------------------------

No installation needed. No backend or database.

1. Download and unzip the folder
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (Chrome/Firefox/Edge/Safari)
3. Use the top navigation to browse between pages
4. The site is fully responsive — works on desktop, tablet, and mobile

----------------------------------------------------
🛠️ HOW TO EDIT
----------------------------------------------------

📝 **HTML**  
Open any `.html` file in VS Code, Notepad++, or Sublime Text  
Update text, menu items, or layout directly in the markup.

🎨 **CSS**  
Edit `style.css` to change:
- Theme colors (glow, backgrounds)
- Font styles
- Spacing, layout, responsiveness

⚙️ **JavaScript**  
All interactivity (custom cursor, scroll animation, order form logic) is inside `script.js`.  
Easily enable/disable features with clear comments.

🖼️ **Images**  
All image files are in the `img/` folder.  
Replace or rename as needed. Make sure to keep sizes optimized for performance.
